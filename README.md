### Hello, folks! ðŸ‘‹


My name is Ritu Gothwal, and I am an enthusiastic data analyst with a PhD degree in Mathematical Environmental modelling. I recently earned a 
certificate from UC Berkeleyâ€™s Data Analytics and Visualization course. I have Intellectual curiosity and analytical skills to find patterns within large sets of structured, semi-structured, and raw data. I find great satisfaction in coding, mathematical/statistical modeling and problem solving. I am meticulous,creative and an effective team player. I published 8 international peer reviewed technical research articles with more than 300 citations; presented the work in two global 
conferences at Singapore and US. Currently I am diving into data analytics and trying to find ways to apply the skills in environmental data analyses. 

I worked on a project and developed a water quality predictor for the lakes of King county, WA.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing an app for predicting water quality index of lakes of Washington State.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning predicting future values using time sereies analysis.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data analytics and environmental modelling.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with job hunting and interview preparation.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to water quality and antibiotic resistance in environmental bacteria...  I know its quite intriguing.
